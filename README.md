### Hi there 👋
I'm Maclean, a full stack software developer located in Sydney, Australia. \
You can view my [portfolio here](https://macleanjs.github.io/). 

⚡ I’m currently learning testing and web browser automation using the [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) framework. 

❤️ I really enjoy picking up new (to me) technologies, diving into documentation, and working on complex problems.

🌱 Ask me about whats currently growing in my garden - or about my terrariums!

📫 You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maclean-staden-a37a93153/) or [Email](mailto:macstaden@gmail.com).
